# COMP604 Lab 2 Assignment 

### Introduction:

This assignment requires you to write a shell script for bash or zsh.

### Task:

Write a bash (or zsh) shell script accepts exactly two arguments from the command-line. The first argument is meant to be a filename of a text file and the second one is the name of a directory. This script should perform the following:

a) Display an appropriate error message and terminate if the number of arguments is not exactly 2.

b) If the file (specified in argument 1) does not exist, then display an appropriate error message and
terminate.

c) Otherwise, saved all the lines in that file that contains the word “special” in a file called special.txt
in the directory specified as argument 2. If this directory does not exist in the current directory, then
create it.

d) If the file special.txt already exists in the directory specified, then those lines of text extracted from
argument 1 should be appended to special.txt.

Your script file MUST be named extract.sh

Your script file should be documented with appropriate comments. Put your group number at the beginning of the script file.

### Submission:
Make sure that you have signed up to an Assignment Group, either as a single-person group or with a partner. Note that if you intend to join someone’s group, you must get their consent.

Submit your script file to Canvas. Each group need only submit once. You are allowed 5 attempts to submit. The last attempt will be the one that is marked.

This assignment will contribute 5% towards your overall course marks.
